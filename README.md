System includes 3 sensor, 2 button which controls two external interrupts to lodge readings from one soil moisture sensor and the other button to turn on one LED. One soil moisture sensor lodges inputs according to a 5 second timer. A PIR sensor lodges the motion when it's detected. Each event could be monitored at the same time because the system uses interrupts, polling and timers.
